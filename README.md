Disk Enumerator

Console tool.

Parse your Host Controller(s) (SAS/SATA) and disk drive(s) (SSD/HDD). Prints a display of all Host Controllers and what drives are connected to that controller. Only displays non-removeable drives. Displays a configurable level of partition table information for each device.

Why?
* Easily see exactly which controller each of your disk drives is connected to!!
* Check what channel / port your disk devices are connected to (+ LUN if required)
* Uses colourised output (optional) & text formatting so it's easy to differentiate each individual device and controller
* Easily control the level of information displayed
* Display partition table associated with each device
